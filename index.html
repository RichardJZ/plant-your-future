  <H1>NATURE<br>Here comes a vizualization of goji and chinese yam berries, grape, apple, pear and asparagus seeds,  behind bars. There is a piece of the bar image hanging like broken wall paper, as if you can tear it. It says: "Set me free". When you click on that part the bars are broken and the berries and seeds are freed and fall into the soil. rain appears. The seeds and berries root, become seedlings, sunshine appears and gradually Paradise appears. All in your existing style (your Superfoods campaign).
  </H1>

  <H1>KITCHEN<br> This vizualization can be eg your existing one. Where plucked food is in the kitchen. </H1>

  <h1>TAKE ACTION<br> How do we get there? first step: eg order your packets and postcards with different seeds and berries. but instead of the square, the jail with the 'wallpaper' flap. Inside are the seeds, as well as an image of Paradise (=flourishing Food Forest in the process of continuous Full Realization which provides food for All in abundance.)</h1>
